*Figure 1 Basic Layout of the App*

## Behaviour:

App can persist in 2 states: Idle and Accelerated.

Initial state is Idle – Button is activated, and symbols are moving around Button with normal speed along a circular path.

States are toggled with Button click.

When a user clicks a Button, App is in Idle state and button is in Active state - App starts a transition to Accelerated state, that lasts for 1 second, indicated by deactivating the button (from green is becomes grey) and increasing speed of symbols.

Accelerated transition ends with activating the button (from grey to green) and symbols now moving 4 times the normal speed.

When user clicks a Button, App is in Accelerated state and Button is in active state – App start a transition to Idle state, that lasts for 1 second, indicated by deactivating the button (from green to grey) and decreasing speed of symbols to normal speed.
Transition ends with activating the button (from grey to green) and symbols moving with normal speed.
